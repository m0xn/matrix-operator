# Matrix operator (float-implementation)
Another branch of development for this repo in order to support floats inside of matrices, as well as for
enhancing the overall architecture of the API. 

## Goals
This is intended to be a small scope project, and the goals I'd like to achieve with it are the following:
- [ ] Matrix API
    - [ ] Matrix structure defintion
    - [ ] Matrix initialization
    - [ ] Matrix duplication
    - [ ] Matrix fill function
    - [ ] Matrix triangulation function
    - [ ] Matrix diagonalization function
    - [ ] Matrix sum
    - [ ] Matrix product
    - [ ] Scalar product
    - [ ] Inverse matrix calculation
    - [ ] Adjugate matrix calculation
- [ ] Determinant API
    -  [ ] 2x2 determinant resolution
    -  [ ] 3x3 determinant resolution (Sarru's Rule)
    -  [ ] determinant order reducer function 
- [ ] Symbolic analizer
