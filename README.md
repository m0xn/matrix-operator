# Matrix operator
Basic program to operate with matrices written in C.

## Goals
This is intended to be a small scope project, and the goals I'd like to achieve with it are the following:
- [x] Define the Matrix structure
- [x] Create stdin Matrix parser
- [ ] Matrix API
    - [x] Init matrix
    - [x] Parse matrix
    - [x] Copy matrix
    - [x] Identity matrix
    - [x] Pretty print matrix
    - [x] Check if a matrix is symmetric
    - [x] Triangulate matrix (upper and lower)
    - [x] Matrix fill method (w/ fill mode, step) 
    - [x] Diagonalize matrix
    - [x] Add/Substract matrices
    - [x] Product matrix
    - [ ] Matrix determinant
